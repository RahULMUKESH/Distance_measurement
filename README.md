I recently completed an exciting project using an Arduino board to create a distance measurement system with an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, an LCD display, and LEDs. The system measures the distance of an object and displays it on the LCD while lighting up different LEDs based on specific distance intervals. For instance, as the object moves closer, the LEDs light up sequentially at 15 cm intervals, providing a clear visual indication of the object's proximity. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of microcontroller programming and sensor integration, and I look forward to applying these skills to future innovations.
